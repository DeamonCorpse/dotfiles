#----- ACTIVE OPTIONS
## When soft line wrapping is enabled, make it wrap lines at blanks
## (tabs and spaces) instead of always at the edge of the screen.
set atblanks

## Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of
## tabs and/or spaces as the preceding line -- or as the next line
## if the preceding line is the beginning of a paragraph.
set autoindent

## Automatically hard-wrap the current line when it becomes overlong.
set breaklonglines

## Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar or minibar.
set constantshow

## Draw a vertical stripe at the given column, to help judge text width.
set guidestripe 80
set stripecolor grey

## Remember the used search/replace strings for the next session.
set historylog

## Display line numbers to the left (and any anchors in the margin).
set linenumbers

## Enable vim-style lock-files.
set locking

## Specify the opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket searches.
## This may not include blank characters. The opening set must come before the closing set,
## and the two sets must be in the same order. The default value is "(<[{)>]}".
set matchbrackets "(<[{)>]}"

## Suppress the title bar and show the filename plus a cursor-position.
## Buffer percentage in the space of the status bar.
set minibar

## Enable mouse support, if available for your system. When enabled,
## mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a
## double click), and execute shortcuts. The mouse will work in the
## X Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.
set mouse

## Spread overlong lines over multiple screen lines.
set softwrap

## Convert each typed tab to the fitting number of spaces.

## Valid names for the foreground and background colors are:
###  red, green, blue, magenta, yellow, cyan, white, and black.
### Each of these eight names may be prefixed with the word light to get a brighter version of that color.
## On terminal emulators that can do at least 256 colors, other valid (but unprefixable) color names are:
### pink,purple, mauve, lagoon, mint, lime, peach, orange, latte, rosy, beet, plum, sea, sky, slate, teal,
### sage, brown, ocher, sand, tawny, brick, crimson, and normal -- where normal means the default foreground
### or background color.
### On such emulators, the color may also be specified as a three-digit hexadecimal number prefixed
### with # and the digits representing the amounts of red, green, and blue, respectively.
